## LIPP Imagine

Sometimes you want characteristics of an image to determine which liip imagine filter is applied.
In this case the `MatchFilterLoader` can be used.

For example: an image in landscape should be scaled using max width, while an image in portrait
should be scaled using max height.  Look in the `MatchFilterLoader` docstring for an example of
this configuration.
